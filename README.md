## Benefits of a Single Page Application (SPA)

SAPs allow the user to interact with the website without downloading entire new webpages from the server. Instead, SAPs rewrites the current webpage based on user interaction. As a result, the app will feel faster and more responsive.

React downloads a Virtual DOM instance from the server to be compared with the browser DOM and render data changes accordingly.

## Interesting fact about SPA

Unlike, traditional web appllications, a SPA canâ€™t have regular anchor tag elements because an anchor tag will load another html file from a server and trigger a refresh the page. And remember that this is a "Single Page Application" so we can't really load another html when there's only one, our "index.html"

## react-router-dom

In this activity, I installed react-router-dom to create an implementation of anchor tags and links, which in reality they only give an illusion of loading different pages to the end user, when in fact they simply load different components into a single element of the real DOM into which the virtual DOM tree gets mounted and updated beased on user interaction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
